### More About Long-term Memory Implementation
- Unlike typical ChatBots with limited context windows, our ChatBot can recall long-term information by querying the database and adding the necessary information back into its context window.
- Implementation:
  - Each message is embedded and stored in the database.
  - If the ChatBot encounters something it doesn't remember, it generates keywords to perform a vector search in the database, retrieves the necessary information, and adds it back to its context window for recall.
  
- Database Memory Implementation:
  - OpenAI embedding: Converts text into vectors representing the meaning of the text.
  - Firebase extension vector search: Embeds the search query and searches the database to find the vector with the nearest distance, which is the most similar message.
  - Retrieves the message and adds it back to the LLM context window.
